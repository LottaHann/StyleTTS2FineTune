1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
I stand here, watching the last of the autumn leaves fall from the elder tree, and my heart

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,760
aches.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:15,720
This tree has witnessed centuries of our stories, the births, the laughter, the love we've shared.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,799
But now it's withering, much like my spirit.

5
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:27,920
The echoes of laughter seem distant now, replaced by silence and shadows.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,360
I fear for what our village will become without its guardian.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,919
I'm losing more than just a tree.

8
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,520
I'm losing a part of myself.
