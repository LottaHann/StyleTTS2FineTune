1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
What sorcery is this?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,760
One moment, I was tending to the garden, and the next, a phoenix bursts forth from the ashes.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,160
I can hardly believe my eyes.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,080
It's magnificent, with feathers shimmering like jewels in the sunlight.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,440
This is no ordinary creature.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,120
It's a sign.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,160
Perhaps the fates are smiling upon us after all.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,760
I must gather the villagers and share this wonder.
