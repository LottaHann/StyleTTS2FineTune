1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Why is everything falling apart at once?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,840
The power grid is malfunctioning and we're running out of oxygen.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,360
How did we not see the storm coming?

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,560
I should have double checked the data logs.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,280
I can't believe I let my guard down.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,920
If we don't stabilize the reactor soon, we'll be trapped here.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,000
I can't fail my crew.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,920
They're counting on me.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,959
Focus, redirect power from the auxiliary systems.

10
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,680
No, that could cause a cascade failure.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,400
Think, I can't afford to make a mistake.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,599
We faced challenges before.

13
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:41,680
We can get through this, but time is running out, and I must act, now.
