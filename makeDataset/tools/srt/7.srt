can you feel it? The air is electric with joy. Today marks the festival of the twin moons, and the entire village is alive with laughter and dance. Children are racing around with their painted faces, and the aroma of roasted chestnuts fills the air. I've never seen the stars shine so brightly, and I feel an overwhelming sense of hope. Moments like these remind me why we fight, why we celebrate life amidst chaos. We are alive, and we are together.
