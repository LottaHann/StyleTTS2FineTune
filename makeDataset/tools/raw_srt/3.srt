1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Wait, what just happened?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,920
One moment, I was chatting with the village elder about the harvest, and

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,320
now I find myself standing in a glade surrounded by shimmering lights.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,720
Is this an enchantment or a trick of the mind?

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,639
I can't make sense of it.

6
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:22,520
Should I call for help or simply follow the lights?

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,600
This feels like a test, but a test of what?

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,719
My heart races, and I don't know what to believe.
