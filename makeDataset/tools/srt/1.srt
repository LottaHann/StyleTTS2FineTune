1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Do you know what makes me happiest?

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,760
Watching my garden bloom every spring.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,800
It's like magic, seeing those tiny seeds I planted come to life.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:18,040
Just last week, I stepped outside and was greeted by the sight of vibrant tulips and daisies dancing in the breeze.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,240
It's a reminder that beauty can grow even after the harshest winters.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,000
And then there are the butterflies.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,520
They flutter around and I can't help but feel a rush of joy.

9
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,520
It's as if they're celebrating with me.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,560
And don't get me started on the smell of fresh flowers.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,880
It fills the air and makes everything feel possible.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,480
Moments like these make me realize that happiness is found in the little things.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,680
Sunshine on my face, the laughter of friends gathered for tea, and the warmth of a good book on a cozy afternoon.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,279
Life is truly a beautiful adventure, and I'm so grateful for every joyful moment.
