1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Oh, dear heavens, what cruel fate has befallen us?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,960
She clasped her hands to her chest, her voice trembling with disbelief.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,400
To find you thus in such a manner is beyond my comprehension.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:24,320
How could I have ventured away, thinking the world was as it should be, only to return to this ghastly sight?

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,280
You were my anchor, my beloved, and now I stand here, utterly lost.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,959
What will become of me?

8
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:36,919
Our hopes and dreams lie shattered upon the floor, and the very air feels heavy with sorrow.

10
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:41,240
I beseech you, do not leave me in this wretched state.

11
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:47,400
Life without you is an unthinkable torment, one I cannot bear to contemplate.

12
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:54,240
I implore the heavens above to restore you, for my heart can scarcely endure this anguish.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,240
