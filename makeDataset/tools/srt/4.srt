00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Ah, another day in Eldenwood.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,520
The sun rises, casting its golden glow over the fields, and I've got chores to finish before the sun sets.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:19,959
I'll need to fetch water from the creek, check on the livestock, and maybe, just maybe, sneak in a few moments to practice my lute.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,879
Life may be simple here, but it's these routines that ground us.

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:28,600
We thrive in the mundane as much as in the magical.
