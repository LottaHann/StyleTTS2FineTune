1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
My God, no, no, no, please, no, this can't be happening.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,480
Her voice trembled as she rushed to his side, her heart pounding in her chest.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,640
Wake up, please, just wake up.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,080
I was only gone for a little while.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,440
Tears streamed down her face as she shook him gently,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,799
desperately searching for any sign of life.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,320
You can't leave me like this.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,639
We had plans.

9
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:28,959
We were supposed to enjoy this weekend together.

10
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,639
Please, don't do this to me.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,880
The reality of the moment crashed over her like a tidal wave, and

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,279
all she could feel was a raw, unbearable pain.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,240
What am I supposed to do without you?

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,160
Please, come back to me.
