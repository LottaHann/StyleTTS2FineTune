{"Cosimo": """You know your family's history well, young lady."""},
{"Lucia": """I know every window we've ever made. Every technique, every innovation... and I've studied Michelozzo's work. The chapel needs windows that complement its architecture—not just decoration, but an integral part of the space."""},
{"Giovanni": """Lucia, please..."""},
{"Cosimo": """No, let her speak. This is exactly the kind of understanding I'm looking for. Tell me, what would you do with these windows?"""},

{"Lucia": """May I?"""},
{"Cosimo": """Please."""},
{"Narrator": """With quick, confident strokes, Lucia begins to sketch."""},
{"Lucia": """The traditional Annunciation poses the Virgin and Gabriel in static opposition. But with Michelozzo's architecture, we could create something more dynamic. See how the light would move through the space?"""},
{"Cosimo": """Fascinating. Maestro Giovanni, you've taught your daughter well."""},
{"Giovanni": """Too well, perhaps."""},
{"Cosimo": """The commission is yours—on one condition. I want the windows completed by the Feast of San Giovanni. The chapel must be ready for the celebrations."""},
{"Lorenzo": """But that's barely six months!"""},
{"Cosimo": """The payment will reflect the urgency. Three hundred florins per window."""},
{"Narrator": """A heavy silence falls over the workshop. It's more money than they've seen in years."""},
{"Giovanni": """We would be honored, Messere. Though I must be honest—my eyes are not what they once were. My son and... my apprentices will need to execute much of the work."""},
{"Cosimo": """As long as the results match the quality I see here, I care little for the method. Do we have an agreement?"""},

{"Narrator": """A crash sounds from the back of the workshop as Lucia sweeps a pile of practice sketches onto the floor."""},
{"Lucia": """Dangerous? What's dangerous is pretending! Pretending that Lorenzo can match your skill, pretending that your sight isn't getting worse every day, pretending that I haven't been the one completing half the commissions for the past year!"""},
{"Giovanni": """Lower your voice."""},
{"Lucia": """Why? The truth doesn't become less true if we whisper it."""},
{"Lorenzo": """The truth? The truth is that if the guild discovers a woman has been painting, they'll revoke Father's license. We'll lose everything."""},

{"Giovanni": """Sometimes I wonder if it was a mistake, letting you spend so much time in the workshop as a child."""},

{"Lorenzo": """That's different. Helping is one thing, but this... this is madness."""},
{"Lucia": """Is it? Look at this panel—really look at it."""},
{"Narrator": """She grabs the Saint Agnes piece, thrusting it toward her brother."""},
{"Lucia": """Tell me honestly that you could have painted this. Tell me anyone in Florence could have painted this better."""},
{"Lorenzo": """That's not the point..."""},
{"Lucia": """It's exactly the point! The Medici don't care who holds the brush—they care about beauty. About excellence. About innovation."""},
{"Giovanni": """Nine hundred florins... it would secure the workshop's future. Pay off our debts to the guild..."""},
{"Lorenzo": """And if we're caught? What then?"""},

{"Lorenzo": """Father, you can't be serious!"""},
{"Giovanni": """I've never been more serious. But Lucia—from this moment forward, every stroke, every design, every choice must be perfect. We cannot afford a single mistake."""},
{"Lucia": """Trust me, Father. I won't let you down."""},

{"Piero": """Most interesting. Your understanding of perspective is quite advanced for someone with no formal training."""},
{"Narrator": """Lucia whirls around, nearly dropping her candle. A tall figure emerges from the shadows—a man in his thirties, well-dressed but with paint stains on his hands."""},
{"Lucia": """How did you get in here? Who are you?"""},
{"Piero": """Piero della Francesca. Your father invited me to consult on the Medici commission."""},
{"Lucia": """At this hour?"""},

{"Lucia": """I don't know what you're talking about. These are my father's works."""},
{"Piero": """Come now. I've known Giovanni for years. His style was always bold, masculine. These designs show a completely different hand—delicate yet precise, with an mathematical understanding of how light moves through space."""},
{"Narrator": """He picks up one of the sketches, holding it to the candlelight."""},
{"Piero": """See how you've calculated the angles of the light's passage? Most glass painters work by intuition alone, but you've approached it as a geometry problem."""},
{"Lucia": """You won't tell anyone?"""},
{"Piero": """Tell them what? That the finest glass painter in Florence has a secret worth far more than mere scandal? No, I have a different proposition."""},
{"Lucia": """What kind of proposition?"""},
{"Piero": """I'm working on a treatise about perspective—the mathematics of vision. Your work here demonstrates principles I've been struggling to explain."""},
{"Lucia": """I don't understand."""},
{"Piero": """I propose an exchange. I'll teach you everything I know about the science of perspective, and you'll allow me to study your techniques with glass and light."""},
{"Narrator": """Lucia studies the man's face in the flickering candlelight, weighing his words."""},
{"Lucia": """And what makes you think I need a teacher?"""},
{"Piero": """Because you're reaching for something new—something that marries art and mathematics in a way I've never seen before. But you're doing it by instinct. Imagine what you could achieve with proper understanding."""},
{"Lucia": """And you'd teach me in secret? Risk your reputation to instruct a woman?"""},
{"Piero": """My dear, I risk my reputation every time I claim that painting should be governed by mathematics rather than tradition. What's one more heresy between colleagues?"""},
{"Narrator": """The first rays of sunrise begin to paint the workshop walls with colored light from the existing windows."""},
{"Lucia": """Meet me here at this same time tomorrow. Bring your treatise—and a better explanation of these mathematical principles you mentioned."""},

{"Narrator": """Lucia's hand tightens on her compass, but she keeps working, head down."""},
{"Giovanni": """If you have an accusation to make, Marco, make it directly."""},
{"Marco": """No accusation. Merely concern for an old friend whose work has suddenly become so... precise. So innovative. Almost as if a different hand holds the brush."""},

{"Giovanni": """It won't be enough. My eyes—"""},
{"Lucia": """Then I'll guide your hands. We've done it before. The guild masters will see exactly what they expect to see: the great Giovanni di Salvatore at work."""},

{"Giovanni": """My hands won't stop shaking."""},
{"Lucia": """They will. The medicine is starting to work. Lorenzo, how do we look from the door?"""},
{"Lorenzo": """Like any other day in the workshop. Though these calculations should be hidden."""},
