1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
I can't shake this feeling of dread.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,040
The whispers in the wind carry tales of darkness spreading beyond the misty mountains.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,240
Our scouts have not returned, and I fear the worst.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,720
What if they encountered the shadow wraiths?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,160
I can't bear the thought of losing anyone else to that evil.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,639
I must gather the council and prepare for what's to come.

7
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:31,760
We can't let fear consume us, but my heart feels heavy with uncertainty.
